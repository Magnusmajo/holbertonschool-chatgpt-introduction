An ChatGpt introduction

==========================
ChatChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to interact with users in a natural, dialogue-based manner. ChatGPT can answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. It is built on the GPT-4 architecture and uses a method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve its responses

### 3. Debugging - Python Mines
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.
Game Overview: Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the player must clear a field of hidden “mines” without detonating any of them, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

### 6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples. (There may be several errors on the code)

Game Overview: Players alternate placing “X” or “O” on a 3x3 board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
