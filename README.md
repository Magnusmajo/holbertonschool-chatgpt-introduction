An ChatGpt introduction

==========================
ChatChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to interact with users in a natural, dialogue-based manner. ChatGPT can answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. It is built on the GPT-4 architecture and uses a method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve its responses

### 3. Debugging - Python Mines
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.
Game Overview: Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the player must clear a field of hidden “mines” without detonating any of them, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

### 6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python
Objective: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples. (There may be several errors on the code)

Game Overview: Players alternate placing “X” or “O” on a 3x3 board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.

####  Some additional info:
###### Debugging
In programming refers to the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors or “bugs” in the source code of a program. These errors can cause unexpected behavior, execution failures, or incorrect results in the application.

The main goal of debugging is to improve the functionality, suitability, and efficiency of the software. Developers use various tools to inspect and modify the code, set breakpoints, and monitor the state of variables during the program’s execution.

###### Automation
In programming refers to the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. This can be applied in various sectors where repetitive tasks are common, such as manufacturing, robotics, automotive industries, and IT systems12.

In the context of programming, automation often involves writing scripts or using tools to automate repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and data processing. This helps improve efficiency, reduce errors, and free up human resources for more complex tasks12.
